This dataset was acquired using various EPI protovols on multiple subjects, multiple sites and multiple MRI vendors and models to develop a method to automate the time-consuming segmentation of the spinal cord for fMRI. The list of subjects is available in [participants.tsv](./participants.tsv).

This dataset follows the [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) convention.
The contributors have the necessary ethics & permissions to share the data publicly.

The dataset does not include any identifiable personal health information, including names,zip codes, dates of birth, facial features.


Each participant's data is in one subdirectory, which contains the mean of motion-corrected volumes (the mean image that was used to draw the spinal cord mask) as well as the associated metadata.
Spinal cord masks that were generated based on mean of motion-corrected volumes are found under derivatives/label/sub-subjectID/sub-subjectID_task-rest_desc-spinalcordmask.nii.gz.
