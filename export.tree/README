This multi-site data set is organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure specification. For more information on this data specification, see https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Each participant's data is in one subdirectory, which contains the mean of motion-corrected volumes  (the mean image that was used to draw the spinal cord mask) as well as the associated metadata.

Spinal cord masks that were generated based on mean of motion-corrected volumes are found under derivatives/label/sub-subjectID/sub-subjectID_task-rest_desc-spinalcordmask.nii.gz.
